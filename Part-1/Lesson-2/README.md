# Lesson Overview


* **The Azure ML Platform :** We'll talk about the core features of the Microsoft Azure ML platform and how they enable us to be more productive as data scientists or machine learning engineers—including how elastic resources give us the power to do ML at scale.

* **Managing and choosing compute resources :** We'll explore the role of compute instances, compute clusters, inference clusters, and attached compute. We'll also consider the tradeoffs involved in choosing resources, such as GPU vs CPU, VM size, cluster size, and dedicated vs low-priority instances.

* **Workspaces and Notebooks :** Workspaces and notebooks are critical components of Microsoft Azure. We'll learn how these tools enable you to be a more effective data scientist—including the use of Jupyter to build and deploy machine learning models.
