# Azure ML SDK

---

* This lesson is all about the Azure ML SDKâ€”and in particular, how to use the SDK to programmatically control and automate our machine learning pipelines. 

* Here are the main topics:

	* **Managing data with the SDK :** 

	We'll get into how to manage our cloud resources with the SDK, including how to do monitoring and logging.

	* **Creating pipelines :** 

	We'll talk about how the Azure ML SDK allows us to programmatically explore, create, and manage pipelines. By automating the creation of 

	* **pipelines :** 

	We can create much larger numbers of pipelines; also, our pipeline creation becomes a a repeatable process that other members of our team can follow.

	* **Managing experiments :** 

	We'll learn how to use the SDK to manage experiments programmatically with Python, allowing us to easily rerun our processes using Python scripts.
