# Lesson Outline: Datastores and Datasets

* This lesson is all about managing data by using Datastores and Datasets. Here are the main topics we'll cover:

#### Managing data :
	
* We'll talk about some of the MLOps workflows that are enabled by managing data within the Azure ML studio platform.


#### Working with Datasets :
	
* Working with datasets is critical for sharing data and having a high performance pipeline that doesn't require copying the data back and forth.


#### Dataset monitoring and data drift : 

* If you collect your data, train a model, and then you get some new customers, those new customers may not be the correct target for the model that you created previouslyâ€”you may need to recreate the model to get a better fit. With Dataset monitoring, you can detect those changes.

#### Using Datasets in notebooks : 
	
* We'll cover the workflow for using Datasets in notebook, and we'll show you how you can leverage the open Datasets that are available in Azure.

#### Dealing with sensitive data : 

* One of the most important topics in ML is how to handle personally identifiable information and protect it using encryption.
