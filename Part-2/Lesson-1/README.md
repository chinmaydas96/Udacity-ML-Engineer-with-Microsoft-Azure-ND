# Introduction to Azure ML

![](screen1.png)

* we will talk about three main points:

#### Deploying a Model

* How to create cluster configuration and compute targets and how to get models into production.

#### Consuming Endpoints
* Consume endpoints to interact with a deployed model in Azure ML Studio.

#### Pipeline Automation

* Some important aspects of pipelines: how to publish one and consume one. Machine Learning operations can greatly benefit directly from automation efforts.

* Machine Learning Operations is related to applying principles of DevOps to Machine Learning, and that will be the focus throughout this course.

## Introduction to Azure ML Ops

* Since at least 2015, there have been concerns about challenges using Machine Learning in applications. But now that industry best-practices like DevOps principles are being applied, this is starting to change.

* One of the most important things is that "DevOps" refers to the collection of principles that allow getting software into production, or in this case, trained models.

* MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is about applying DevOps best-practices and principles to machine learning operations.

* The book Python for DevOps has several key concepts that demonstrate what can be achieved when DevOps principles are applied. Another useful resource is Azure's resources on Machine Learning Operations, which covers important details about the mix of DevOps and Machine Learning.

## Tools & Dependencies

* Although you will interact primarily with Azure Machine Learning Studio, the Python SDK will be used as well. Some other tools that will be used in this course are:

	* Azure ML studio
	* Azure Python SDK
	* Jupyter Notebooks
	* Swagger
	* Apache Benchmark
	* Terminal

* Note, the instructor is using a Mac terminal, so some of the commands or operations shown by the instructor in this course may be somewhat different if you are using a Windows System and a PowerShell as the terminal.

* This course will also provide you a Github repo that contains starter codes for exercises and the project. Please clone the Github repo to your account.
